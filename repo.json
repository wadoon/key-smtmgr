                    "description": "new in 4.8.1\r\n\r\n- New requirements:\r\n  - A breaking change to the API is that parsers for SMT-LIB2 formulas return a vector of \r\n    formulas as opposed to a conjunction of formulas. The vector of formulas correspond to \r\n    the set of \"assert\" instructions in the SMT-LIB input.\r\n\r\n- New features\r\n   - A parallel mode is available for select theories, including QF_BV. \r\n     By setting parallel.enable=true Z3 will spawn a number of worker threads proportional to the \r\n     number of available CPU cores to apply cube and conquer solving on the goal.\r\n   - The SAT solver by default handle cardinality and PB constraints using a custom plugin \r\n     that operates directly on cardinality and PB constraints.\r\n   - A \"cube\" interface is exposed over the solver API. \r\n   - Model conversion is first class over the textual API, such that subgoals created from running a \r\n     solver can be passed in text files and a model for the original formula can be recreated from the result.\r\n   - This has also led to changes in how models are tracked over tactic subgoals. The API for \r\n     extracting models from apply_result have been replaced.\r\n   - An optional mode handles xor constraints using a custom xor propagator. \r\n     It is off by default and its value not demonstrated.\r\n   - The SAT solver includes new inprocessing techniques that are available during simplification.\r\n     It performs asymmetric tautology elimination by default, and one can turn on more powerful inprocessing techniques \r\n     (known as ACCE, ABCE, CCE). Asymmetric branching also uses features introduced in Lingeling by exploiting binary implication graphs.\r\n     Use sat.acce=true to enable the full repertoire of inprocessing methods. By default, clauses that are \"eliminated\" by acce are tagged\r\n     as lemmas (redundant) and are garbage collected if their glue level is high.\r\n   - Substantial overhaul of the spacer horn clause engine.\r\n   - Added basic features to support Lambda bindings.\r\n   - Added model compression to eliminate local function definitions in models when\r\n     inlining them does not incur substantial overhead. The old behavior, where models are left\r\n     uncompressed can be replayed by setting the top-level parameter model_compress=false.\r\n   - Integration of a new solver for linear integer arithmetic and mixed linear integer arithmetic by Lev Nachmanson.\r\n     It incorporates several improvements to QF_LIA solving based on\r\n     . using a better LP engine, which is already the foundation for QF_LRA\r\n     . including cuts based on Hermite Normal Form (thanks to approaches described \r\n       in \"cuts from proofs\" and \"cutting the mix\").\r\n     . extracting integer solutions from LP solutions by tightening bounds selectively.\r\n       We use a generalization of Bromberger and Weidenbach that allows avoiding selected\r\n       bounds tighthenings (https://easychair.org/publications/paper/qGfG).\r\n     It solves significantly more problems in the QF_LIA category and may at this point also \r\n     be the best solver for your problem as well.\r\n     The new solver is enabled only for select SMT-LIB logics. These include QF_LIA, QF_IDL, and QF_UFLIA.\r\n     Other theories (still) use the legacy solver for arithmetic. You can enable the new solver by setting\r\n     the parameter smt.arith.solver=6 to give it a spin.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Removed features:\r\n  - interpolation API\r\n  - duality engine for constrained Horn clauses.\r\n  - pdr engine for constrained Horn clauses. The engine's functionality has been \r\n    folded into spacer as one of optional strategies.\r\n  - long deprecated API functions have been removed from z3_api.h\r\n  \r\n",

It\r\n    supports basic operators like union disjoint, union max, intersection,\r\n    difference subtract, difference remove, duplicate removal, and multiplicity\r\n    of an element in a bag. \r\n\r\n* *Theory of Sequences*\r\n  - A new parametric theory of sequences whose syntax is compatible with the\r\n    syntax for sequences used by Z3.\r\n  - A new array-inspired procedure (option `--seq-array`).\r\n\r\n* *Arithmetic*\r\n  - Nonlinear real arithmetic is now solved using a new solver based on\r\n    cylindrical algebraic coverings. Includes full support for non-rational\r\n    models and a number of options `--nl-cov-*` for, e.g., different projection\r\n    operators, Lazard's lifting or variable elimination.\r\n    The new solver requires the libpoly library, and Lazard's lifting\r\n    additionally requires CoCoALib.\r\n\r\n* *Arrays*\r\n  - Added support for an `eqrange` predicate. `(eqrange a b i j)` is true\r\n    if arrays `a` and `b` are equal on all indices within indices `i` and `j`.\r\n\r\n* *Bit-vectors*\r\n  - New bit-vector solver with CaDiCaL as default SAT back-end.\r\n  - New approach for solving bit-vectors as integers (option `--solve-bv-as-int`).\r\n\r\n* *Datatypes*\r\n  - Support for generic datatype updaters `((_ update s) t u)` which replaces\r\n    the field specified by selector `s` of `t` by the value `u`.\r\n\r\n* *Integers*\r\n  - Support for an integer operator `(_ iand n)` that returns the bitwise `and`\r\n    of two integers, seen as integers modulo n.\r\n  - Support for an integer operator `int.pow2`, used as `(int.pow2 x)` which\r\n    represents 2 to the power of x.\r\n\r\n* *Quantifiers*\r\n  - Improved support for enumerative instantiation (option `--enum-inst`).\r\n  - SyGuS-based quantifier instantiation (option `--sygus-inst`).\r\n\r\n* *Strings*\r\n  - Improved performance using new techniques, including model-based\r\n    reductions, eager context-dependent simplification, and equality-based\r\n    conflict finding.\r\n  - Support for `str.indexof_re(s, r, n)`, which returns the index of the first\r\n    occurrence of a regular expression `r` in a string `s` after index `n` or\r\n    -1 if `r` does not match a substring after `n`.\r\n\r\n* *Proofs*\r\n  * Documentation available at:\r\n    https://cvc5.github.io/docs/latest/proofs/proofs.html\r\n  * When used after an unsatisfiable response to `checkSat`, `getProof`\r\n    returns a representation of the refutation proof for the current set of\r\n    assertions (get-proof in SMT-LIB).\r\n  * Preliminary support for translations to external proof formats LFSC and Alethe.\r\n\r\n* *Difficulty Estimation*\r\n  - The API method `getDifficulty` returns a map from asserted formulas to\r\n    integers which estimates how much that formula contributed to the\r\n    difficulty of the overall problem (get-difficulty in SMT-LIB).\r\n\r\n* *Learned Literals*\r\n  - The API method `getLearnedLiterals` gets a list of literals that are\r\n    entailed by the current set of assertions that were learned during solving\r\n    (get-learned-literals in SMT-LIB).\r\n\r\n* *Abduction and Interpolation*\r\n  * The API method `getAbduct` can be used to find an abduct for the current set\r\n    of assertions and provided goal (get-abduct in SMT-LIB). Optionally, a\r\n    SyGuS grammar can be provided to restrict the shape of possible abducts.\r\n    If using the text inferace, the grammar may be provided using the same\r\n    syntax for grammars as in SyGuS IF format.\r\n  * The API method `getInterpolant` can be used to find an interpolant for the\r\n    current set of assertions and provided goal (get-interpolant in SMT-LIB).\r\n    Like abduction, grammars may be provided to restrict the shape of\r\n    interpolants.\r\n\r\n* *Support for Incremental Synthesis Queries*\r\n  - The core SyGuS solver now supports getting multiple solutions for a\r\n    synthesis conjecture via the API. The method `checkSynthNext` finds the\r\n    next SyGuS solution to the current set of SyGuS constraints\r\n    (check-synth-next in SyGuS IF).\r\n  - `getAbductNext` finds the next abduct for the current set of\r\n    assertions and provided goal (get-abduct-next in SMT-LIB).\r\n  - `getInterpolantNext` finds the next interpolant for the current set of\r\n    assertions and provided goal (get-interpolant-next in SMT-LIB).\r\n\r\n* *Pool-based Quantifier Instantiation*\r\n  - The API method `declarePool` declares symbol sets of terms called pools\r\n    (`declare-pool` in SMT-LIB).\r\n  - Pools can be used in annotations of quantified formulas for fine grained\r\n    control over quantifier instantiations (:inst-pool, :inst-add-to-pool,\r\n    :skolem-add-to-pool in SMT-LIB).\r\n\r\n* Diagnostic Outputs\r\n  - The option `-o TAG` can be used to enable a class of useful diagnostic\r\n    information, such as the state of the input formula before and after\r\n    pre-preprocessing, quantifier instantiations, literals learned\r\n    during solving, among others. For SyGuS problems, it can be used to\r\n    show candidate solutions and grammars that the solver has generated.\r\n\r\n* *Unsat cores*\r\n  - Production modes based on the new proof infrastructure\r\n    (`--unsat-cores-mode=sat-proof`) and on the solving-under-assumption\r\n    feature of Minisat (`--unsat-cores-mode=assumptions`). The mode based on\r\n    SAT assumptions + preprocessing proofs is the new default.\r\n  - Computing minimal unsat cores (option `--minimal-unsat-cores`).\r\n\r\n* *Blocking Models*\r\n  - The API method `blockModels` can be used to block the current model using\r\n    various policies for how to exclude the values of terms (`block-model` in\r\n    SMT-LIB).\r\n  - The API method `blockModelValues` can be used to block the current model\r\n    for a provided set of terms (`block-model-values` in SMT-LIB).\r\n\r\n* *Model Cores*\r\n  - The API method `isModelCoreSymbol` can be used to query whether the value\r\n    for a symbol was critical to whether the model satisfies the current set of\r\n    assertions.\r\n  - Models can be limited to show only model core symbols (option `--model-cores`).\r\n\r\n**Changes**\r\n\r\n* CaDiCaL and SymFPU are now required dependencies. CaDiCaL 1.4.1 is now the\r\n  version used by default.\r\n* Options have been extensively refactored, please refer to the cvc5\r\n  documentation for further information.\r\n* Removed support for the CVC language.\r\n* SyGuS: Removed support for SyGuS-IF 1.0.\r\n* Removed support for the (non-standard) `define` command.\r\n* Removed the legacy API along with the Java and Python bindings for it.\r\n* Interactive shell: the GPL-licensed Readline library has been replaced the\r\n  BSD-licensed Editline. Compiling with `--best` now enables Editline, instead\r\n  of Readline. Without selecting optional GPL components, Editline-enabled CVC4\r\n  builds will be BSD licensed.\r\n* The `competition` build type includes the dependencies used for SMT-COMP by\r\n  default. Note that this makes this build type produce GPL-licensed binaries.\r\n* Bit-vector operator `bvxnor` was previously mistakenly marked as\r\n  left-assoicative in SMT-LIB. This has recently been corrected in SMT-LIB. We\r\n  now restrict `bvxnor` to only allow two operands in order to avoid confusion\r\n  about the semantics, since the behavior of n-ary operands to `bvxnor` is now\r\n  undefined in SMT-LIB.\r\n* SMT-LIB output for `get-model` command now conforms with the standard,\r\n  and does *not* begin with the keyword `model`. The output\r\n  is the same as before, only with this word removed from the beginning.\r\n* Building with Python 2 is now deprecated.\r\n* The SMT-LIB syntax for some extensions has been changed. Notably, set\r\n  operators are now prefixed by `set.`, and relations by `rel.`. For example,\r\n  `union` is now written `set.union`.\r\n* Removed support for redundant logics `ALL_SUPPORTED` and `QF_ALL_SUPPORTED`,\r\n  use `ALL` and `QF_ALL` instead.\r\n",

                    "description": "Changes since 1.7\r\n=================\r\n\r\nNew Features:\r\n* New C++ and Python API: CVC4 has a new, more streamlined API. We plan to\r\n  make CVC4 1.8 the last version that ships with the legacy API.\r\n* Strings: Full support of the new SMT-LIB standard for the theory of strings,\r\n  including:\r\n  * Support for `str.replace_re`, `str.replace_re_all`, `str.is_digit`,\r\n    `str.from_code`, `re.diff`, and `re.comp`\r\n  * Support for new operator names (e.g. `str.in_re` instead of `str.in.re`),\r\n    new escape sequences. The new syntax is enabled by default for smt2 files.\r\n* Support for syntax-guided synthesis (SyGuS) problems in the new API. C++\r\n  examples of the SyGuS API can be found in `./examples/api/sygus_*.cpp`.\r\n* Support for higher-order constraints. This includes treating function sorts\r\n  (constructible by `->`) as first-class sorts and handling partially applied\r\n  function symbols. Support for higher-order constraints can be enabled by\r\n  the option `--uf-ho`.\r\n* Support for set comprehension binders `comprehension`.\r\n* Eager bit-blasting: Support for SAT solver Kissat.\r\n\r\nImprovements:\r\n* API: Function definitions can now be requested to be global. If the `global`\r\n  parameter is set to true, they persist after popping the user context.\r\n* Java/Python bindings: The bindings now allow users to catch exceptions\r\n* Arithmetic: Performance improvements\r\n  * Linear solver: New lemmas inspired by unit-cube tests\r\n  * Non-linear solver: Expanded set of axioms\r\n* Ackermannization: The Ackermannization preprocessing pass now supports\r\n  uninterpreted sorts and as a result all QF_UFBV problems are supported in\r\n  combination with eager bit blasting.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n* CVC language: Models printed in the CVC language now include an explicit end\r\n  marker to facilitate the communication over pipes with CVC4.\r\n* API change: `SmtEngine::query()` has been renamed to\r\n  `SmtEngine::checkEntailed()` and `Result::Validity` has been renamed to\r\n  `Result::Entailment` along with corresponding changes to the enum values.\r\n* Java API change: The name of CVC4's package is now `edu.stanford.CVC4`\r\n  instead of `edu.nyu.acsys.CVC4`.\r\n* The default output language is changed from CVC to SMT-LIB 2.6. The\r\n  default output language is used when the problem language cannot be\r\n  easily inferred (for example when CVC4 is used from the API).\r\n* Printing of BV constants: previously CVC4 would print BV constant\r\n  values as indexed symbols by default and in binary notation with the\r\n  option --bv-print-consts-in-binary. To be SMT-LIB compliant the\r\n  default behavior is now to print BV constant values in binary\r\n  notation and as indexed symbols with the new option\r\n  --bv-print-consts-as-indexed-symbols. The option\r\n  --bv-print-consts-in-binary has been removed.\r\n* Updated to SyGuS language version 2.0 by default. This is the last release\r\n  that will support the SyGuS language version 1.0 (`--lang=sygus1`). A\r\n  script is provided to convert version 1.0 files to version 2.0, see\r\n  `./contrib/sygus-v1-to-v2.sh`.\r\n* Support for user-provided rewrite rule quantifiers have been removed.\r\n* Support for certain option aliases have been removed.\r\n* Support for parallel portfolio builds has been removed.",

Given a formula, this option uses\r\n    CVC4's SyGuS solver to find a sufficient condition such that the\r\n    conjunction of the condition and the formula is unsatisfiable.\r\n  * Support for two new term enumerator strategies: variable agnostic\r\n    (`--sygus-active-gen=var-agnostic`) and fast (`--sygus-active-gen=enum`).\r\n    By default, CVC4 tries to choose the best term enumerator strategy\r\n    automatically based on the input (`--sygus-active-gen=auto`).\r\n  * Support for streaming solutions of increasingly smaller size when using the\r\n    PBE solver (`--sygus-stream --sygus-pbe`). After the first solution is found\r\n    and printed, the solver will continue to look for new solutions and print\r\n    those, if any, that are smaller than previously printed solutions.\r\n  * Support for unification-based techniques in non-separable specifications\r\n    (`--sygus-unif`). For solving invariant problems a dedicate mode\r\n    (`--sygus-unif-boolean-heuristic-dt`) is available that builds candidate\r\n    solutions using heuristic decision tree learning.\r\n\r\nImprovements:\r\n* Strings:\r\n  * Significantly better performance on string benchmarks over the core theory\r\n    and those with extended string functions like substring, contains, and\r\n    replace.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n* API change: Expr::iffExpr() is renamed to Expr::eqExpr() to reflect its\r\n              actual behavior.\r\n* Compiling the language bindings now requires SWIG 3 instead of SWIG 2.\r\n* The CVC3 compatibility layer has been removed.\r\n* The build system now uses CMake instead of Autotools.
